# yelp_interview - intersection and unions between interested businesses
A sample of my solution for the interview at yelp with improvements.
I did not get an offer to proceed to next stage, most likely because my final interview code was not passing all the test cases (duh) since had no time to refactor after finishing main solution.

I put up the code to encourage discussion with other candidates that had similar interview question :)
Other solution that could be considered would be to sort the input vector of reviews, extract the businessofinterset and create a set. iterate over the sorted vector and calculate intersections and unions while keeping track of most similar business. Return it
